        <p><i><u>Geography (Location & Area)
                    South Korea is located in Asia on the Korean Peninsula; it measures a total of 100,188.1 „é¢ and takes
                    up 45% of
                    the Korean Peninsula, which is a total of of 221,000 „é¢. The total area of the peninsula includes all
                    of the
                    Korean Peninsula and its annexed islands, occupied by both South and North Korea. The Korean
                    Peninsula is
                    slightly larger than Cambodia (181,035 „é¢), and about 2/3 the size of the Philippines (300,000 „é¢),
                    Vietnam
                    (331,210 „é¢), and Japan (377,915 „é¢). The Korean Peninsula, on which South Korea and North Korea are
                    located,
                    neighbors China to the northwest with Amnokgang (River) as its borderline, and China and Russia to
                    the northeast
                    with Dumangang (River) as its borderline. The peninsula is bordered by the Yellow Sea in the west,
                    the East Sea
                    in the east, and the South Sea in the south. The southern and western parts of Korea are plains,
                    while the
                    eastern and the northern parts are mountainous. The highest mountain in Korea is Baekdusan (2,744m).
                    Gaemagowon,
                    which is in the northern part of Korea, is called "the Roof of Korea," and the Taebaek Range located
                    on the east
                    coast is called ‚ÄúBaekdudaegan‚Äù. Korea's best- known islands include Jeju Island, Geoje Island, Jin
                    Island and
                    Ulleung Island. Jeju Island and Ulleung Island were formed by volcanic activities. The west coast
                    and the south
                    coast of Korea are rias coasts, and there is a large tidal range. Source: Ministry of Land,

    <h1>HISTORY OF SOUTH KOREA</h1>
    <div class="main2">
        <img src="./Daedongyeojijeondo_small.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="420">
        <p>After Japan's defeat in the Pacific War in 1945, the Korean region, which was part of Japan's territory, was
            occupied by American and Soviet forces. In 1948, with the end of the U.S. military government, South Korea
            declared its independence from Japan as the Republic of Korea. In 1952, when Japan approved the independence
            of the Korean region under the San Francisco Peace Treaty, it became a completely independent and sovereign
            nation under international law. The unconditional surrender of Japan led to the division of Korea into two
            occupation zones (similar to the four zones in Germany), with the United States administering the southern
            half of the peninsula and the Soviet Union administering the area north of the 38th parallel. This division
            was meant to be temporary (as was in Germany) and was first intended to return a unified Korea back to its
            people after the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China could arrange a single government
            for the peninsula.

            The two parties were unable to agree on the implementation of a Joint Trusteeship over Korea because of 2
            different opinions.[2] This led in 1948 to the establishment of two separate governments with the two very
            opposite ideologies; the Communist-aligned Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the West-aligned
            First Republic of Korea ‚Äì each claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea. On 25 June 1950,
            the Korean War broke out. After much destruction, the war ended on 27 July 1953, with the 1948 status quo
            being restored, as neither the DPRK nor the First Republic had succeeded in conquering the other's portion
            of the divided Korea. The peninsula was divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone and the two separate
            governments stabilized into the existing political entities of North and South Korea.

            South Korea's subsequent history is marked by alternating periods of democratic and autocratic rule.
            Civilian governments are conventionally numbered from the First Republic of Syngman Rhee to the contemporary
            Sixth Republic. The First Republic, arguably democratic at its inception (though preceded by major
            anti-communist and anti-socialist purges), became increasingly autocratic until its collapse in 1960. The
            Second Republic was strongly democratic but was overthrown in under a year and replaced by an autocratic
            military regime. The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Republics were nominally democratic, but are widely regarded
            as the continuation of military rule.[3] With the current Sixth Republic, the country has gradually
            stabilized into a liberal democracy.

        <p>City: Seoul

            Meaning: The word ‚ÄòSeoul‚Äô (ÏÑúÏö∏) is the name of the capital of South Korea. Next to it, you will see the word
            you just learned, ‚ÄòDaehakyo‚Äô (ÎåÄÌïôÍµê).

            You have most likely heard about this University as it is the most famous and prestigious in the country.
            Founded in 1946, Seoul National University (SNU) has always been on the list of Top Universities in South
            Korea.

            Among others, it is recognized as the most prestigious place in which many young people want to study, often
            working their hardest to pass the ‚ÄòSuneung College Scholastic Ability Test‚Äô after graduating from high
            school. This test is the most difficult exam in the world, and it marks the students‚Äô careers, work, and
            even personal life. Without a high score in this exam, there is no chance of being accepted into Seoul
            National University, as it is the most competitive in the country.

            However, you can take a breath now, as it is a completely different story for foreigners. As an
            international student, you don‚Äôt have to take that exam to be accepted.

            But! That doesn‚Äôt mean it gets any easier during the admission process. SNU has a very low acceptance rate,
            from 15% to 20%, which means you need to qualify for the excellence that the admission panel is looking for
            in its students.

            You will have to prove your competency as an academic with a high GPA, an admirable study plan, and a
            personal statement. In addition, you need to back up your application with quality letters of
            recommendation, a quality portfolio, if applicable, and any other achievements that you can mention to
            impress the admission panel.

            According to my friends who have studied at Seoul National University, it is indeed much easier for
            foreigners to be admitted to this Institute compared to Koreans. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that you can get in
            easily, as it is still pretty tough.

            Also, if you decide to study here, you can also rest assured that many courses are taught in English,
            especially in the engineering and business departments. However, you can always take Korean language courses
            on the campus to increase your level of proficiency.

                City: Daejon (Daejeon Innopolis District)

                Meaning: The word ‚ÄòÌïúÍµ≠‚Äô (Hanguk) is the name of the country in the Korean language. Gwahakk Gisurwon
                (Í≥ºÌïôÍ∏∞Ïà†Ïõê) means ‚Äòinstitute of science and technology.‚Äô

                It was founded in 1971 in South Korea as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIS), later merging
                technology to become the Institute of Science and Technology that it is today (KAIST). The purpose of
                this Institute from the beginning has been to increase the number of professional and talented
                scientists and engineers in the country, having the best structure of graduate and undergraduate
                education in Korea.

                The United States Agency for International Development had a strong impact on the foundation of this
                institution, as well as the Korean president of that time, who supported the idea.

                According to KAIST‚Äôs history written on their website, the people who designed the academic scheme were
                Frederick E. Terman, founder of Silicon Valley and ex-president of Stanford University, with Chung
                Geum-mo, a renowned professor at the Polytechnic Institution of Brooklyn.

                So is this a good choice for international students? For sure! If you are looking for a science and
                technology university to study abroad, this is one of the best options.

                But is it hard to get admission as an international student? Out of all the universities, this is one of
                the hardest to get into, but similar to SNU, the situation differs when it comes to foreigners. KAIST is
                interested in having potentially great talents studying on their campus, and so they offer many
                scholarships for students who come from abroad.
